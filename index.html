                <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
                    physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment
                    at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
                    venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
                </p>
                <p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic 
                    particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he 
                    discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A 
                    potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have 
                    infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, 
                    causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a 
                    prodigiously violent instant.
                </p>
                <p>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens 
                    look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. 
                    The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities. 
                    Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, 
                    like spit in the ocean.
                </p>
                <p>“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and 
                    drew a double box around it.
                </p>
                <p>On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that 
                    they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, 
                    known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
                </p>
                <p>Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic 
                    time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by 
                    John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected 
                    ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves — 
                    the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was 
                    roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. 
                    They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. 
                    Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
